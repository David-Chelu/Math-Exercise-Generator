A project that randomly generates math exercises, starting with basic addition and subtraction, as well as more complex ones.
These can be set to other number bases, not just decimal.
Generator class takes for input horizontal and vertical complexity, as well as value ranges.
This means the simplest exercise will be an addition of 2 numbers between 1 and 5, and the most complex ones can contain 17 operations with exponent of 6 and root order of 7, with 11 variables and with values between 10e9 and 10e14.
